Let's build [FOSS CrossOver][foss-crossover] for macOS in the cloud! I found [some gists][crossover-gist] and I asked myself why don't we use the cloud and the free open source builders to build this? Here it is.

## How this works?

1. See [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
2. See [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](./.github/workflows/build.yml)
3. See [`build_local.sh`](./build_local.sh)

## Is it working?

Not for me, see [#6](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/issues/6)

## Inspiration

I learned about [Free and Open Source Software Code for CrossOver][foss-crossover] and found [this gist][crossover-gist].

## Where to download builds?

See [#2](https://github.com/GabLeRoux/macos-crossover-cloud-build/issues/2)

## Can I run the build locally?

It will only work if you're on macOS, but yes.
Clone the project, read the scripts first, then feel free to run [`build_local.sh`](./build_local.sh) üëç.
The script is a copy of the steps done in the github action in [`.github/workflows/build.yml`](./.github/workflows/build.yml).
It contains some variables to allow for customizations.

## Can I contribute?

Definitely. Feel free to send PRs üöÄ
