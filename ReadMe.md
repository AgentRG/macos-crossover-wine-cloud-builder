# MacOS CrossOver FOSS built from the Cloud

I found some gists explaining how to build CrossOver on MacOS in some gists. I asked myself why don't we use the cloud and open source to build this? Here it is.

## Where to download builds

There is probably something tricky in providing the builds. I'm not sure if it can be distributed freely. If you know the answer, let me know.

## How this works?

1. See [Travis - The macOS Build Environment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/osx/)
2. See [`.travis.yml`]
3. See [`build.sh`](./build.sh)

## Inspiration

I leanred about [Free and Open Source Software Code for CrossOver](https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover/source) and found [this gist](https://gist.github.com/sarimarton/471e9ff8046cc746f6ecb8340f942647)
